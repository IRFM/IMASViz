Description

**IMASViz** is a visualization tool developed within Integrated
**Modelling Analysis Suite** (**IMAS)** for the purposes of visualizing static
and dynamic IMAS data, stored within IMAS **Interface Data Structures**
(**IDSs**).
While the tool itself is already available for use it is still under active
development, and various features, GUI improvements etc. are still being
implemented.

The tool uses the following Python packages:



**1. PyQt5**

    PyQt5 is comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as
    more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative
    application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including
    iOS and Android.

    Qt is set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for
    accessing many aspects of modern desktop and mobile systems.

**2. pyqtgraph**

    Pyqtgraph is a graphics and user interface library for Python that provides
    functionality commonly required in engineering and science applications. Its
    primary goals are a) to provide fast, interactive graphics for displaying data
    (plots, video, etc.) and b) to provide tools to aid in rapid application
    development (for example, property trees such as used in Qt Designer).

    PyQtGraph makes heavy use of the Qt GUI platform (via PyQt or PySide) for its
    high-performance graphics and numpy for heavy number crunching. In particular,
    pyqtgraph uses Qtâ€™s GraphicsView framework which is a highly capable graphics
    system on its own; we bring optimized and simplified primitives to this
    framework to allow data visualization with minimal effort.

**3. matplotlib**

    Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality
    figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
    platforms.

**4. sphinx**

    Sphinx is a tool originally created as a Python documentation generator
    but it allows also generation of documentation as html, latex etc.

IMASViz tool is available on ITER git repository (access permission is required)
under Visualization/VIZ project.
